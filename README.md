The repo takes the previous WebGL example and extends it by incorporating a MPU9250 IMU into the application, and visualizes the rotation data.
<br><br>
The code and steps required for setup are detailed in the article, [Visualizing the MPU9250 IMU with WebGL](https://www.netburner.com/learn/visualizing-the-mpu9250-imu-with-webgl/),
which is presented on NetBurner's site at www.netburner.com.
<br><br>
This project was developed for NetBurner's NNDK 2.8.x and 2.9.x
